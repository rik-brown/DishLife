Objects 10.00%
The code creates an object with the constructor function (not using prototype method).

Vectors 10.00
The object stores its position, velocity, and acceleration as vectors.

Forces 10.00
The object incorporates an applyForce() function.

Steering 20.00%
The object uses Reynoldsâ€™ steering formula: steering = desired - velocity.

IDEA:
The objects are 'cells' that change shape over time (eventually dying, when they get too small)
They become 'fertile' when the size falls beneath a certain threshold
They become 'infertile' when they have spawned a new cell
Fertile cells are attracted towards other fertile cells, but will move away from unfertile cells
New cells are born infertile
