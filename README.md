_Kadenze Nature of Code Assignment 3: Steering Forces_

IDEA:
The objects are 'cells' that change shape over time (eventually dying, when they get too small)
They become 'fertile' when the size falls beneath a certain threshold
They become 'infertile' when they have spawned a new cell
Fertile cells are attracted towards other fertile cells, but will move away from unfertile cells
